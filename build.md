- YT Music now also has version restrictions. check [README.md](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches#-comgoogleandroidappsyoutubemusic)
- in case of RVX Music, clean installation is recommended
- in case of YouTube, the patch is not broken even in the latest beta: `YouTube v18.35.35 beta`
- as some patches may not be applied properly in the latest version due to a/b tests, so I marked the supported version as `YouTube v18.31.40`
